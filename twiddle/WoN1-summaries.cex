urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.1.1188#The principal benefit of foreign trade is not the importation of gold and silver, but the carrying out of surplus produce for which there is no demand and bringing back something for which there is.

urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1213#High duties and prohibitions direct people to employ capital in producing at home what they could buy cheaper from abroad
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1214#It is as foolish for a nation as for an individual to make what can be bought cheaper.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1215#Sometimes by such regulations a manufacture may be established earlier than it would otherwise have been, but this would make capital accumulate slower,
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1216#and the country might always be just as rich if it never acquired the manufacture.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1217#No one proposes that a country should strive against great natural advantages, but it is also absuid to strive against smaller advantages whether natural or acquired.

urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1219#The free importation of foreign cattle would make no great difference to British graziers.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1220#It might even benefit the cultivated plains at the expense of the rugged mountainous districts.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1221#The free importation of salt provisions also would make little difference to the graziers,
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1222#and even the free importation of corn would not much affect the farmers.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1223#Country gentlemen and farmers are less subject to the spirit of monopoly than merchants and manufacturers.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1224#The prohibition of foreign corn and cattle restraints the population.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1225#There are two cases which are exceptional,
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1226#(1) when a particular industry is necessary for the defence of the country, like shipping, which is properly encouraged by the act of navigation,
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1231#a wise act, though dictated by animosity,
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1232#and unfavourable to foreign commerce;
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1233#and (2) when there is a tax on the produce of the like home manufacture.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1234#Some people say that this principle justifies a general imposition of duties on imports to counterbalance taxes levied at home on necessaries,
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1235#but there is a difference,
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1236#since ( a ) the effect of taxes on necessaries cannot be exactly known,
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1237#and ( b ) taxes on necessaries are like poor soil or bad climate: they cannot justify an attempt to give capital an unnatural direction.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1238#Taxes on necessaries are commonest in the richest countries because no others could support them
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1239#There are two other possible exceptions to the general principle
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1240#(1) Retaliation
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1241#may be good policy where it is likely to secure the abolition of foreign restraints.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1242#(2) It may be desirable to introduce freedom of trade by slow gradations.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1242#But the disorder occasioned by its sudden introduction would be less than is supposed since
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1243#( a ) no manufacture which is now exported would be affected;
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1244#( b ) the people thrown out of one employment would easily find another,
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1244#especially if the privileges of corporations and the law of settlement were abolished.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1245#Private interests are too strong to allow of the restoration of freedom of trade in Great Britain.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.2.1246#The fact that equitable regard is due to the manufacturer who has fixed capital in his business is an argument against the establishment of new monopolies.

urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1248#British restraints on imports from France are an example.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1248#Such restraints are unreasonable on the principles of the mercantile system, since
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1249#(1) if free trade with France did lead to an unfavourable balance with France, it might yet not do so with the world in general,
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1250#(2) a part of French imports might be re-exported and bring back gold and silver,
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1251#and (3) the balance cannot be certainly known:
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1251#custom-house books are useless,
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1252#and the course of exchange is little better.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1253#A favourable exchange with a particular country does not prove a favourable balance with that country.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1254#Besides, the ordinary computation of exchange is often misleading, since
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1256#(1) money is often below its nominal standard,
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1257#(2) coin is sometimes raised by seignorage above the value of the bullion contained in it,
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1258#and (3) bank money bears an agio.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1259#Small states must admit foreign coin, which is of uncertain value.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1260#Banks are then established to pay in standard money regardless of the condition of the coin, and this money bears an agio.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1261#Before 1609 the common currency of Amsterdam was 9 per cent. below the standard.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1262#The bank was then established to receive and pay coin at its intrinsic value in good standard money.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1263#Money in the bank was not only up to the standard, but also secure and easily transferred, so that it bore an agio.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1264#The bank receives bullion as well as coin, giving in exchange a credit in bank money to 95 per cent of the value.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1264#It also gives a receipt which entitles the bearer to recover the bullion on repaying the sum advanced and paying ¼ per cent. for silver and ½ per cent. for gold.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1265#The receipts are generally worth something, and are renewed at the end of each six months.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1266#The depositor usually parts with his receipt.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1267#The bank money and the receipt together equal in value the bullion deposited.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1268#Receipts for current coin are also given, but these are often of no value and are allowed to expire.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1269#So there is a considerable sum of bank money for which the receipts have expired, but it is not a large proportion of the whole.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1270#This cannot be drawn out of the bank.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1271#So that if all the holders of bank money desired to exchange it for coin and bullion receipts might command an exorbitant price.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1272#Of late years the bank has always sold bank money at 5 per cent. agio and bought at 4 per cent.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1273#It professes to lend out no part of the deposits.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1274#The amount of treasure in the bank is a subject of conjecture.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1275#The city derives a considerable revenue from the various profits of the bank.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1277#The whole doctrine of the balance of trade is absurd.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1279#Where there is an even balance and the exchange consists wholly of native commodities two countries trading will gain nearly equally.
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1280#If one exported nothing but native commodities, and the other nothing but foreign, both would gain, but the first would gain most.

urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:4.3.1291#which is quite different from the balance of trade,
