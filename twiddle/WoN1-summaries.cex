urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.1.236#<span class="type-margin"><span>as may be better understood from a particular example,</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.1.237#<span class="type-margin"><span>such as pin-making.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.1.238#<span class="type-margin"><span>The effect is similar in all trades and also in the division of employments.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.1.239#<span class="type-margin"><span>The advantage is due to three circumstances,</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.1.240#<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) improved dexterity,</span></span>

urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.2.246#<span class="type-margin"><span>The division of labour arises from a propensity in human nature to exchange.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.2.247#<span class="type-margin"><span>This propensity is found in man alone.</span></span>

urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.4.272#<span class="type-margin"><span>Three questions,</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.4.272#<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) wherein consists the real price of commodities, (2) what are the different parts of this price, (3) why the market price sometimes diverges from this price,</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.4.276#<span class="type-margin"><span>will be answered in the next three chapters.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.277#<span class="type-margin"><span>Labour is the real measure of exchangeable value,</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.278#<span class="type-margin"><span>and the first price paid for all things.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.279#<span class="type-margin"><span>Wealth is power of purchasing labour.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.280#<span class="type-margin"><span>But value is not commonly estimated by labour, because labour is difficult to measure.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.281#<span class="type-margin"><span>and commodities are more frequently exchanged for other commodities,</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.282#<span class="type-margin"><span>especially money, which is therefore more frequently used in estimating value.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.283#<span class="type-margin"><span>But gold and silver vary in value, sometimes costing more and sometimes less labour, whereas equal labour always means equal sacrifice to the labourer,</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.284#<span class="type-margin"><span>although the employer regards labour as varying in value.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.285#<span class="type-margin"><span>So regarded, labour has a real and a nominal price.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.286#<span class="type-margin"><span>The distinction between real and nominal is sometimes useful in practice,</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.287#<span class="type-margin"><span>since the amount of metal in coins tends to diminish,</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.288#<span class="type-margin"><span>and the value of gold and silver to fall.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.289#<span class="type-margin"><span>English rents reserved in money have fallen to a fourth since 1586,</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.290#<span class="type-margin"><span>and similar Scotch and French rents almost to nothing.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.291#<span class="type-margin"><span>Corn rents are more stable than money rents,</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.292#<span class="type-margin"><span>but liable to much larger annual variations,</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.293#<span class="type-margin"><span>so that labour is the only universal standard.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.294#<span class="type-margin"><span>But in ordinary transactions money is sufficient,</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.295#<span class="type-margin"><span>being perfectly accurate at the same time and place,</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.296#<span class="type-margin"><span>and the only thing to be considered in transactions between distant places.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.297#<span class="type-margin"><span>So it is no wonder that money price has been more attended to.</span></span>

urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.299#<span class="type-margin"><span>Several metals have been coined, but only one is used as the standard, and that usually the one first used in commerce,</span></span>

urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.302#<span class="type-margin"><span>The standard metal originally was the only legal tender,</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.303#<span class="type-margin"><span>later the proportion between the values of the two metals is declared by law, and both are legal tender, the distinction between them ceasing to be of importance,</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.304#<span class="type-margin"><span>except when a change is made in the regulated proportion.</span></span>

urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.5.316#<span class="type-margin"><span>Fluctuations in the market price of gold and silver are due to ordinary commercial causes, but steady divergence from mint price is due to the state of the coin.</span></span>

urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.462#<span class="type-margin"><span>Actual differences of pecuniary wages and profits are due partly to counter-balancing circumstances and partly to want of perfect liberty</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.464#<span class="type-margin"><span>There are five counter-balancing circumstances:</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.465#<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) Wages vary with the agreeableness of the employment.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.466#<span class="type-margin"><span>Some very agreeable employments are exceedingly ill paid.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.467#<span class="type-margin"><span>The same thing is true of profits.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.468#<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) Wages vary with the cost of learning the business.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.471#<span class="type-margin"><span>The cost of apprenticeship accounts for the wages of manufacturers being higher than those of country labourers</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.472#<span class="type-margin"><span>Education for liberal professions is more costly and the pecuniary recompense consequently higher. Profits are not much affected by this circumstance.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.474#<span class="type-margin"><span>(3) Wages vary with constancy of employment.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.479#<span class="type-margin"><span>Constancy does not affect profits.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.480#<span class="type-margin"><span>(4) Wages vary with the trust to be reposed.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.483#<span class="type-margin"><span>Profits are unaffected by trust</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.484#<span class="type-margin"><span>(5) Wages vary with the probability of success.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.486#<span class="type-margin"><span>Law and similar professions are nevertheless crowded.</span></span>

urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.489#<span class="type-margin"><span>The greater part of men have an over-weening conceit of their abilities:</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.490#<span class="type-margin"><span>lotteries show that the chance of gain is over-valued,</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.491#<span class="type-margin"><span>and the moderate profit of insurers shows that the chance of loss is undervalued.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.492#<span class="type-margin"><span>Young people are particularly prone to over-value the chance of gain and under-value the risk of loss.</span></span>

urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.497#<span class="type-margin"><span>Profits are less unequal than wages, and their inequality is often only due to the inclusion of wages,</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.498#<span class="type-margin"><span>as in the case of the profit of an apothecary,</span></span>

urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.500#<span class="type-margin"><span>The greater difference between retail and wholesale profits in town than country is due to the same cause.</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.501#<span class="type-margin"><span>The lesser rate of profit in towns yields larger fortunes, but these mostly arise from speculation.</span></span>

urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.503#<span class="type-margin"><span>but three things are necessary as well as perfect freedom:</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.504#<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) the employments must be well known and long established,</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.505#<span class="type-margin"><span>since new trades yield higher wages,</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.506#<span class="type-margin"><span>and higher profits:</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.507#<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) the employments must be in their natural state,</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.508#<span class="type-margin"><span>since the demand for labour in each employment varies from time to time</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.509#<span class="type-margin"><span>and profits fluctuate with the price of the commodity produced:</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.510#<span class="type-margin"><span>and (3) the employments must be the principal employment of those who occupy them, since people maintained by one employment will work cheap at another, like the Scotch cotters,</span></span>

urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.517#<span class="type-margin"><span>in three ways:</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.518#<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) It restricts competition in some employments,</span></span>
urn:cts:fufolio:adamsmith.won.fu2018.heads:1.10.519#<span class="type-margin"><span>principally by giving exclusive privileges to corporations, which require long apprenticeship and limit the number of apprentices.</span></span>
