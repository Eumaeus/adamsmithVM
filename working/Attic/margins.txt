<span class="type-margin"><span>The produce of annual labour supplies annual consumption,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>better or worse according to the proportion of produce to people,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>which proportion is regulated by the skill, etc., of the labour and the proportion of useful labourers,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and more by the skill, etc., than by the proportion of useful labourers, as is shown by the greater produce of civilised societies.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The causes of improvement and natural distribution are the subject of Book I.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Capital stock, which regulates the proportion of useful labourers, is treated of in Book II.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The circumstances which led Europe to encourage the industry of the towns and discourage agriculture are dealt with in Book III.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The theories to which different policies have given rise are explained in Book IV.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The expenditure, revenue and debts of the sovereign are treated of in Book V.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Division of labour is the great cause of its increased powers,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>as may be better understood from a particular example,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>such as pin-making.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The effect is similar in all trades and also in the division of employments.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The advantage is due to three circumstances,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) improved dexterity,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) saving of time,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and (3) application of machinery, invented by workmen,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>or by machine-makers and philosophers.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Hence the universal opulence of a well-governed society,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>even the day-labourer&#x2019;s coat being the produce of a vast number of workmen.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The division of labour arises from a propensity in human nature to exchange.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>This propensity is found in man alone.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It is encouraged by self-interest and leads to division of labour,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>thus giving rise to differences of talent more important than the natural differences.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and rendering those differences useful.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Division of labour is limited by the extent of the power of exchanging.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Various trades cannot be carried on except in towns.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Water-carriage widens the market,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and so the first improvements are on the sea-coast or navigable rivers,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>for example among the ancient nations on the Mediterranean coast.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Improvements first took place in Egypt,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Bengal and China;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>while Africa, Tartary and Siberia, and also Bavaria, Austria and Hungary are backward.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Division of labour being established, every man lives by exchanging.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Difficulties of barterlead to the selection of one commodity as money,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>for example, cattle, salt, shells, cod, tobacco, sugar, leather and nails.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Metals were eventually preferred because durable and divisible.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Iron, copper, gold and silver,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>were at first used in unstamped bars,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and after wards stamped to show quantity and fineness;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>stamps to show fineness being introduced first,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and coinage to show weight later.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The names of coins originally expressed their weight.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The next inquiry is what rules determine exchangeable value.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Value may mean either value in use or value in exchange.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Three questions,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) wherein consists the real price of commodities, (2) what are the different parts of this price, (3) why the market price sometimes diverges from this price,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>will be answered in the next three chapters.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Labour is the real measure of exchangeable value,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and the first price paid for all things.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Wealth is power of purchasing labour.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>But value is not commonly estimated by labour, because labour is difficult to measure.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and commodities are more frequently exchanged for other commodities,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>especially money, which is therefore more frequently used in estimating value.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>But gold and silver vary in value, sometimes costing more and sometimes less labour, whereas equal labour always means equal sacrifice to the labourer,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>although the employer regards labour as varying in value.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>So regarded, labour has a real and a nominal price.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The distinction between real and nominal is sometimes useful in practice,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>since the amount of metal in coins tends to diminish,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and the value of gold and silver to fall.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>English rents reserved in money have fallen to a fourth since 1586,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and similar Scotch and French rents almost to nothing.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Corn rents are more stable than money rents,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but liable to much larger annual variations,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>so that labour is the only universal standard.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>But in ordinary transactions money is sufficient,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>being perfectly accurate at the same time and place,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and the only thing to be considered in transactions between distant places.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>So it is no wonder that money price has been more attended to.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>In this work corn prices will sometimes be used.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Several metals have been coined, but only one is used as the standard, and that usually the one first used in commerce,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>as the Romans used copper,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and modern European nations silver.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The standard metal originally was the only legal tender,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>later the proportion between the values of the two metals is declared by law, and both are legal tender, the distinction between them ceasing to be of importance,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>except when a change is made in the regulated proportion.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>During the continuance of a regulated proportion, the value of the most precious metal regulates the value of the whole coinage, as in Great Britain,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>where the reformation of the gold coin has raised the value of the silver coin.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Silver is rated below its value in England.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Locke&#x2019;s explanation of the high price of silver bullion is wrong.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>If the silver coin were reformed, it would be melted.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Silver ought to be rated higher and should not be legal tender for more than a guinea.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>If it were properly rated, silver bullion would fall below the mint price without any re-coinage.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>A seignorage would prevent melting and discourage exportation.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Fluctuations in the market price of gold and silver are due to ordinary commercial causes, but steady divergence from mint price is due to the state of the coin.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The price of goods is adjusted to the actual contents of the coinage.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Quantity of labour is originally the only rule of value,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>allowance being made for superior hardship,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and for uncommon dexterity and ingenuity.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The whole produce then belongs to the labourer,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but when stock is used, something must be given for the profits of the undertaker, and the value of work resolves itself into wages and profits.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Profits are not merely wages of inspection and direction.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The labourer shares with the employer, and labour alone no longer regulates value.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>When land has all become private property, rent constitutes a third component part of the price of most commodities.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The real value of all three parts is measured by labour.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>In an improved society all three parts are generally present,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>for example, in corn,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>in flour or meal,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and in flax.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Rent is a smaller proportion in highly manufactured commodities.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>A few commodities have only two or even one of the three component parts.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>But all must have at least one,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and the price of the whole annual produce resolves itself into wages, profits and rent,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>which are the only original kinds of revenue.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>They are sometimes confounded,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>for example, a gentleman farmer&#x2019;s rent is called profit,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>a common farmer&#x2019;s wages are called profit,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and so are an independent manufacturer&#x2019;s wages,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>while the rent and profit of a gardener cultivating his own land are considered earnings of labour.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>A great part of the annual produce goes to the idle; the proportion regulates the increase or diminution of the produce.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Ordinary or average rates of wages, profit,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and rent</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>may be called natural rates,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>to pay which a commodity is sold at its natural price,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>or for what it really costs, which includes profit,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>since no one will go on selling without profit.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Market price</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>is regulated by the quantity brought to market and the effectual demand.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>When the quantity brought falls short of the effectual demand, the market price rises above the natural;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>when it exceeds the effectual demand the market price falls below the natural;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>when it is just equal to the effectual demand the market and natural price coincide.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It naturally suits itself to the effectual demand.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>When it exceeds that demand, some of the component parts of its price are below their natural rate;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>when it falls short, some of the component parts are above their natural rate.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Natural price is the central price to which actual prices gravitate.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Industry suits itself to the effectual demand,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but the quantity produced by a given amount of industry sometimes fluctuates.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The fluctuations fall on wages and profit more than on rent,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>affecting them in different proportions according to the supply of commodities and labour.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>But market price may be kept above natural for a long time,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>in consequence of want of general knowledge of high profits,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>or in consequence of secrets in manufactures,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>which may operate for long periods,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>or in consequence of scarcity of peculiar soils,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>which may continue for ever.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>A monopoly has the same effect as a trade secret,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>the price of monopoly being the highest which can be got.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Corporation privileges, etc., are enlarged monopolies.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Market price is seldom long below natural price,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>though apprenticeship and corporation laws sometimes reduce wages much below the natural rate for a certain period</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Natural price varies with the natural rate of wages, profit and rent.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Wages will be dealt with in chapter viii.,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>profit in chapter ix.,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>differences of wages and profit in chapter x.,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and rent in chapter xi.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Produce is the natural wages of labour.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Originally the whole belonged to the labourer.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>If this had continued, all things would have become cheaper,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>though in appearance many things might have become dearer.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>This state was ended by the appropriation of land and accumulation of stock,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>rent being the first deduction,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and profit the second, both in agriculture,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and other arts and manufactures.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The independent workman gets profits as well as wages,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but this case is infrequent.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Wages depend on contract between masters and workmen.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The masters have the advantage,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>though less is heard of masters&#x2019; combinations than of workmen&#x2019;s.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>But masters cannot reduce wages below a certain rate,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>namely, subsistence for a man and something over for a family</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Wages may be considerably above this rate,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>when there is an increasing demand for labourers,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>which is caused by an increase of the funds destined for the payment of wages. The funds consist of</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>surplus revenue,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and surplus stock.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The demand for labourers therefore increases with the increase of national wealth.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>High wages are occasioned by the increase, not by the actual greatness of national wealth.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>North America is more thriving than England.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Wages are not high in a stationary country however rich.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>China is not going backwards and labourers there keep up their numbers.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>In a declining country this would not be the case.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>In Great Britain wages are above the lowest rate,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>since (1) there is a difference between winter and summer wages,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) wages do not fluctuate with the price of provisions,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(3) wages vary more from place to place than the price of provisions,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and (4) frequently wages and the price of provisions vary in opposite directions, as grain is cheaper and wages are higher in England than in Scotland;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and in last century grain was dearer and wages were lower than in this;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>while other necessaries and conveniencies have also become cheaper.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>High earnings of labour are an advantage to the society.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Poverty does not prevent births</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but is unfavourable to the rearing of children,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and so restrains multiplication,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>while the liberal reward of labour encourages it,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>as the wear and tear of the free man must be paid for just like that of the slave, though not so extravagantly.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>High wages increase population.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The progressive state is the best for the labouring poor</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>High wages encourage industry.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The opinion that cheap years encourage idleness is erroneous.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Wages are high in cheap years,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and low in dear years,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>so that masters commend dear years.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Messance shows that in some French manufactures more is produced in cheap years.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>No connexion is visible between dearness or cheapness of the years and the variations in Scotch linen and Yorkshire woollen manufactures</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The produce depends on other circumstances, and more of it escapes being reckoned in cheap years</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>There is, however, a connexion between the price of labour and that of provisions.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>In years of plenty there is a greater demand for labour,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and in years of scarcity a less demand,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and the effect of variations in the price of provisions is thus counterbalanced.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Increase of wages increases prices, but the cause of increased wages tends to diminish prices.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Profits depend on increase and decrease of wealth,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>falling with the increase of wealth.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The rate is difficult to ascertain,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but may be inferred from the rate of interest,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>which has fallen in England,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>while wealth has been increasing.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Profits are lower in towns, where there is much stock, than in the country, where there is little.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Interest is higher in Scotland, a poor country, than in England.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>So too in France, a country probably less rich than England,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but lower in Holland, which is richer than England.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>In the peculiar case of new colonies high wages and high profits go together, but profits gradually diminish.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>New territories and trades may raise profits even in a country advancing in riches.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Diminution of capital stock raises profits.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>In a country as rich as it possibly could be, profits as well as wages would be very low,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but there has never yet been any such country.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Interest is raised by defective enforcement of contracts,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and by prohibition.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The lowest rate of profit must be more than enough to compensate losses,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and so must the lowest rate of interest.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>In a country as rich as it possibly could be interest would be so low that only the wealthiest people could live on it.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The highest rate of profit would eat up all rent and leave only wages.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The proportion of interest to profit</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>rises and falls with the rate of profit.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Countries with low profits can sell as cheap as those with low wages; and in reality high profits tend to raise prices more than high wages.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Advantages and disadvantages tend to equality where there is perfect liberty.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Actual differences of pecuniary wages and profits are due partly to counter-balancing circumstances and partly to want of perfect liberty</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>There are five counter-balancing circumstances:</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) Wages vary with the agreeableness of the employment.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Some very agreeable employments are exceedingly ill paid.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The same thing is true of profits.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) Wages vary with the cost of learning the business.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The cost of apprenticeship accounts for the wages of manufacturers being higher than those of country labourers</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Education for liberal professions is more costly and the pecuniary recompense consequently higher. Profits are not much affected by this circumstance.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(3) Wages vary with constancy of employment.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Constancy does not affect profits.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(4) Wages vary with the trust to be reposed.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Profits are unaffected by trust</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(5) Wages vary with the probability of success.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Law and similar professions are nevertheless crowded.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Public admiration makes a part of the reward of superior abilities,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>except in the peculiar case of players, opera-singers, &amp;c.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The greater part of men have an over-weening conceit of their abilities:</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>lotteries show that the chance of gain is over-valued,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and the moderate profit of insurers shows that the chance of loss is undervalued.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Young people are particularly prone to over-value the chance of gain and under-value the risk of loss.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>For this reason soldiers are poorly paid,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and sailors not much better.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Dangers which can be surmounted attract, though mere unwholesomeness repels.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Profits vary with certainty of return.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Profits are less unequal than wages, and their inequality is often only due to the inclusion of wages,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>as in the case of the profit of an apothecary,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>or country grocer.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The greater difference between retail and wholesale profits in town than country is due to the same cause.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The lesser rate of profit in towns yields larger fortunes, but these mostly arise from speculation.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The five circumstances thus counter-balance differences of pecuniary gains,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but three things are necessary as well as perfect freedom:</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) the employments must be well known and long established,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>since new trades yield higher wages,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and higher profits:</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) the employments must be in their natural state,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>since the demand for labour in each employment varies from time to time</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and profits fluctuate with the price of the commodity produced:</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and (3) the employments must be the principal employment of those who occupy them, since people maintained by one employment will work cheap at another, like the Scotch cotters,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Shetland knitters,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Scotch linen spinners,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and London lodging house keepers.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The policy of Europe occasions more important inequalities</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>in three ways:</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) It restricts competition in some employments,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>principally by giving exclusive privileges to corporations, which require long apprenticeship and limit the number of apprentices.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Seven years is the usual period of apprenticeship.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The Statute of Apprenticeship, which required it everywhere in England, has been confined to market towns,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and to trades existing when it was passed.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The term varies in France,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and Scotland, where the regulations are less oppressive.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>All such regulations are as impertinent as oppressive.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Long apprenticeships are no security against bad work,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and do not form young people to industry</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Apprenticeships were unknown to the ancients</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Long apprenticeships are altogether unnecessary</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Corporations were established to keep up prices and consequently wages and profit;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>by means of which the towns gained at the expense of the country,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>being enabled to get the produce of a larger quantity of country labour in exchange for the produce of a smaller quantity of their own,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>as the exports of a town are the real price of its imports.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>That town industry is better paid is shown by the large fortunes made in it.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Combination is easy to the inhabitants of a town,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and difficult to those of the country, who are dispersed and not governed by the corporation spirit. No apprenticeship is prescribed for farming, though a difficult art,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>or for the inferior branches of country labour, which require more skill than most mechanic trades.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The superiority of town industry is enhanced by other regulations, such as high duties on foreign manufactures.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The superiority has declined in Great Britain.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Meetings of people in the same trade ought not to be facilitated,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>as by registration of traders,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>by the establishment of funds for the sick, widows and orphans,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>or by incorporation.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Corporations are unnecessary, and corrupt the workmen.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) The policy of Europe increases competition in some trades.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It cheapens the education of the clergy and thereby reduces their earnings;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>so that it is only the great benefices, etc., which support the honour of the English and Roman Catholic Churches.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The same cause, if present, would lower the reward of lawyers and physicians,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>as it has done that of men of letters,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and that of teachers,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>who were much better paid in ancient times.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Perhaps this cheapness of teaching is no disadvantage to the public.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(3) The policy of Europe obstructs the free circulation of labour.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Apprenticeship and corporation privileges obstruct circulation from employment to employment and from place to place.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>So that the changes of employment necessary to equalise wages are prevented.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>What obstructs the circulation of labour also obstructs that of stock.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>In England the circulation of labour is further obstructed by the poor law.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Each parish was to support its own poor under 43 Eliz., c. 2,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>these were determined by 13 and 14 Car. II. to be such as had resided forty days, within which time, however, a new inhabitant might be removed.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Notice in writing was required from the new inhabitant by 1 James II.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Such notice was to be published in church under 3 W III.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>There were four other ways of gaining a settlement,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>two of which were impossible to all poor men,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and the other two to all married men.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and to all independent workmen</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Certificates were invented to enable persons to reside in a parish without being immediately removable and without gaining a settlement.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Certificates were required by the new parish but refused by the old.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The courts declined to force overseers to give a certificate.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>This law is the cause of the very unequal price of labour in England,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and an evident violation of natural liberty, though tamely submitted to</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Wages were anciently rated by law or by justices of peace.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>London tailors&#x2019; wages are still rated by law.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Attempts were also made to regulate profits by fixing prices, and the assize of bread still remains.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The inequalities of wages and profits are not much affected by the advancing or declining state of the society.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Rent is the produce which is over what is necessary to pay the farmer ordinary profit.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It is not merely interest on stock laid out in improvements,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and is sometimes obtained for land incapable of improvement, such as rocks where kelp grows,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and for the opportunity to fish.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It is therefore a monopoly price</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Whether particular parts of produce fetch a price sufficient to yield a rent depends on the demand.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Some parts are always in sufficient demand: others sometimes are and sometimes are not.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Wages and profit are causes of price; rent is an effect.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The chapter is divided into three parts.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Food can always purchase as much labour as it can maintain.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Almost all land produces more than enough food to maintain the labour and pay the profits, and therefore yields rent.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The rent varies with situation as well as with fertility.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Good roads, etc., diminish differences of rent.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Corn land yields a larger supply of food after maintaining labour than pasture.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>In early times meat is cheaper than bread,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but later on it becomes dearer,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and pasture yields as good a rent as corn land,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and sometimes a greater one,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>as in the neighbourhood of a great town,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>or all over a populous country which imports corn,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>such as Holland and ancient Italy,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and occasionally in a country where enclosure is unusual.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Ordinarily the rent of corn land regulates that of pasture.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Improved methods of feeding cattle lower meat in proportion to bread.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The price of meat was higher at the beginning of the seventeenth century</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>than in 1763-4,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>whereas wheat was cheaper.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The rent and profit of corn land and pasture regulate those of all other land.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The apparently greater rent or profit of some other kinds is only interest on greater expense,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>as in hop, and fruit gardens,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>kitchen-gardens;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and vineyards.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Land fitted for a particular produce may have a monopoly,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>such as that which produces wine of a particular flavour,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>or the West Indian sugar colonies,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and in a less degree the tobacco plantations of Virginia and Maryland</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>So the rent of cultivated land producing food regulates that of most of the rest,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and in Europe the rent of corn</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>If the common food was such as to produce a greater surplus, rent would be higher</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>for example, rice,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>or potatoes.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Wheat is probably a better food than oats,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but not than potatoes,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Potatoes, however, are perishable.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The materials of clothing and lodging, at first super-abundant, come in time to afford a rent</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>For example, hides and wool,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>stone and timber.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Population depends on food:</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>so the demand for the materials of clothing and lodging is increased by greater case of obtaining food,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>which thus makes them afford rent.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>They do not, however, even then always afford rent:</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>for example, some coal-mines are too barren to afford rent,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>or too disadvantageously situated.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The price of coal is kept down by that of wood,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>which varies with the state of agriculture</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>But in the coal countries coal is everywhere much below this price.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The lowest possible price is that which only replaces stock with profits.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Rent forms a smaller proportion of the price of coal than of that of most other rude produce.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The situation of a metallic mine is less important than that of a coal mine,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>metals from all parts of the world being brought into competition</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Rent has therefore a small share in the price of metals.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Tin and lead mines pay a sixth in Cornwall and Scotland.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The silver mines of Peru formerly paid a fifth,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and now only a tenth,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>while profits are small</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Mining is encouraged in Peru by the interest of the sovereign</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The gold mines of Peru now pay only a twentieth in rent.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The lowest price of the precious metals must replace stock with ordinary profits,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but their highest price is determined by their scarcity.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The demand for them arises from their utility and beauty:</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and the merit of beauty is enhanced by their scarcity.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The demand for precious stones arises altogether from their beauty enhanced by their scarcity.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The rent of mines of precious metals and precious stones is in proportion to their relative and not to their absolute fertility.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Abundant supplies would add little to the wealth of the world</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>But in estates above ground both produce and rent are regulated by absolute fertility.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Abundance of food raises the value of other produce.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The general course of progress is for produce other than food to become dearer,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but there are interruptions,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>as in the case of silver,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>when new fertile mines are discovered.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Silver would grow dearer in the general progress of improvement,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but might grow cheaper if some accident increased the supply for many years together:</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>or remain stationary if demand and supply increased equally.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>These three things have happened during the last 400 years.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>From 1350 to 1570 silver gradually fell</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>In 1350 wheat was 4 oz. of silver per quarter,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and was not less than that at the beginning of the century,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and for some time before.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>From that it sank gradually to 2 oz. at the beginning of the sixteenth century and remained at that till 1570.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The same fall has been observed in France.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It may have been due to the increase of demand for silver or to a diminution of supply.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Most writers, however, have supposed that the value of silver continually fell.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>They have been misled in their observations on the price of corn, (1) by confusing conversion prices with market prices;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) by the slovenly transcription of ancient statutes of assize;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>or by misunderstandings of those statutes,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and (3) by attributing too much importance to excessively low prices.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The figures at the end of the chapter confirm this account.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Sometimes the value of silver has been measured by the price of cattle, poultry, etc. But the low price of these things shows their cheapness, not the dearness of silver,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>for labour is the real measure.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Cattle, poultry, etc., are produced by very different quantities of labour at different times,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>whereas corn scarcely varies at all,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and also regulates the money price of labour.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The authors were also misled by the notion that silver falls in value as its quantity increases.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Increase of quantity arising from greater abundance of the mines is connected with diminution of value,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but increase of quantity resulting from the increased wealth of a country is not</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Gold and silver are dearer in a rich country,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>as may be shown by comparing China with Europe and Scotland with England as to the price of subsistence.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Gold and silver are cheapest among the poorest nations.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The fact that corn is dearer in towns is due to its dearness there, not to the cheapness of silver,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and this is true also in Holland, Genoa, etc.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>So no increase of silver due to the increase of wealth could have reduced its value.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>No doubt exists as to the second period,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>silver sank, and a quarter of corn came to be worth 6 oz. or 8 oz. of silver.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>This was owing to the discovery of the abundant American mines.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Wheat rose at Windsor market.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The effect of the discovery of the American mines was complete about 1636.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>From 1637 to 1700 there was a very slight rise of wheat at Windsor,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>due to the civil war,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>the bounty on the exportation of corn,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and the clipping and wearing of the coin,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>which was then much greater than in the present century.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Moreover the bounty has been long enough in existence to produce any possible effect in lowering the price of corn.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Silver has risen somewhat since the beginning of the century, and the rise began before,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>as is shown by Mr. King&#x2019;s calculations.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>A part from its effect in extending tillage, the bounty raises the price of corn, both in times of plenty and of scarcity.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It is said to have extended tillage (and so to have reduced the price), but the rise of silver has not been peculiar to England.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The alteration should be regarded as a rise of silver rather than a fall of corn.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The recent high price of corn is merely the effect of unfavourable seasons.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The bounty kept up the price between 1741 and 1750.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The sudden change at 1750 was due to accidental variation of the seasons.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The rise in the price of labour has been due to increase of demand for labour, not to a diminution in the value of silver.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The decrease in the rent and profit of mines of gold and silver</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>has been stayed by the gradual enlargement of the market,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) in Europe,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) in America itself,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and (3) in the East Indies,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>where the value of gold and silver was, and still is, higher than in Europe</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The supply of silver must provide for waste as well as increase of plate and coin.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Waste is considerable.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Six millions of gold and silver are imported at Cadiz and Lisbon,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>as shown by Magens,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Raynal,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and other authors.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>This is not the whole of the annual supply, but by far the greater part.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Brass and iron increase, but we do not expect them to fall in value. Why then gold and silver?</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>In consequence of their durability the metals, especially gold and silver, vary little in value from year to year.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>After the discovery of the American mines silver fell in proportion to gold</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It is higher in the East</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Magens seems to think the proportion of value should be the same as the proportion of quantity,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but this is absurd</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The whole of a cheap commodity is commonly worth more than the whole of a dear one, and this is the case with silver and gold.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Gold is nearer its lowest possible price than silver.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Diamonds are nearer still.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It may be necessary to reduce still further the tax on silver in Spanish America.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The greater cost of raising silver must lead to an increase of its price, or a reduction of the tax upon it, or both.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The reduction of the tax in the past makes silver at least 10 per cent. lower than it would otherwise have been.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Silver has probably risen somewhat in the present century.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The annual consumption must at length equal the annual importation.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and will then accommodate itself to changes in the importation.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Gold and silver are supposed to be still falling because they are increasing in quantity and some sorts of rude produce are rising.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It has already been shown that the increase of the metals need not diminish their value:</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and the rise of cattle, etc., is due to a rise in their real price, not to a fall of silver.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The real price of three sorts of rude produce rises in the progress of improvement:</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) The sort which cannot be multiplied by human industry, such as game.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>When it becomes profitable to cultivate land to yield food for cattle, the price of cattle cannot go higher.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It must go to this height in order to secure complete cultivation.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Consequently new colonies are poorly cultivated.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Cattle are the first of this second sort of rude produce to bring in the price necessary to secure cultivation,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and venison is the last;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>other things are intermediate,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>such as poultry,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>hogs,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>milk, butter and cheese.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The rise of price, being necessary for good cultivation, should be regarded with satisfaction.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It is due not to a fall of silver but to a rise in the real price of the produce.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(3) The sort in regard to which the efficacy of industry is limited or uncertain,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Wool and hides in early times have a larger market open to them than butcher&#x2019;s-meat.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>In thinly inhabited countries the wool and hide are more valuable in proportion to the carcase.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>In the progress of improvement the wool and hide should rise, though not so much as the carcase</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>But in England wool has fallen since 1339.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>This has been caused by artificial regulations.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The real price of hides at present is somewhat lower than in the fifteenth century,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but their average price during the present century is probably higher.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>They are not so easily transported as wool,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and tanners have not been so much favoured by legislation as clothiers</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Regulations which sink the price of wool or hides in an improve country raise the price of meat,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but not in an unimproved country.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The Union sank the price of Scotch wool, while it raised the price of Scotch meat.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The efficacy of industry in increasing wool and hides is both limited and uncertain.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The same thing is true of fish, which naturally rise in the progress of improvement</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The connexion of success in fishing with the state of improvement is uncertain.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>In increasing minerals the efficacy of industry is not limited but uncertain.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The quantity of the precious metals in a country depends on its power of purchasing and the fertility of the mines.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>So far as it depends on the former circumstance the real price is likely to rise with improvement;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>so far as it depends on the latter circumstance the real price will vary with the fertility of the mines,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>which has no connexion with the state of industry.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The high value of the precious metals is no proof of poverty and barbarism,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but the low price of cattle, poultry, game, &amp;c., is a proof of poverty or barbarism.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>A rise of price due entirely to degradation of silver would affect all goods equally, but corn has risen much less than other provisions,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and has indeed been somewhat lower in 1701-64 than in 1637-1700,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>while its recent high price has been due only to bad seasons.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The distinction between a rise of prices and a fall in the value of silver is not useless:</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>it affords an easy proof of the prosperity of the country,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and may be of use in regulating the wages of the inferior servants of the state.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The poor are more distressed by the artificial rise of some manufactures than by the natural rise of rude produce other than corn.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>But the natural effect of improvement is to diminish the price of manufactures.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>In a few manufactures the rise in the price of raw material counterbalances improvement in execution,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but in other cases price falls considerably.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Since 1600 this has been most remarkable in manufactures made of the coarser metals.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Clothing has not fallen much in the same period,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but very considerably since the fifteenth century.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Fine cloth has fallen to less than one-third of its price in 1487,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and coarse cloth has fallen to less than one half of its price in 1463.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Hose have fallen very considerably since 1463,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>when they were made of common cloth.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The machinery for making cloth has been much improved,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>which explains the fall of price.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The coarse manufacture was a household one,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but the fine was carried on in Flanders by people who subsisted on it, and was subject to customs duty,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>which explains why the coarse was in those times lower in proportion to the fine.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Every improvement in the circumstances of society raises rent</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Extension of improvement and cultivation raises it directly,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and so does the rise in the price of cattle, &amp;c.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Improvements which reduce the price of manufactures raise it indirectly,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and so does every increase in the quantity of useful labour employed.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The contrary circumstances lower rent.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>There are three parts of produce and three original orders of society.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The interest of the proprietors of land is inseparably connected with the general interest of the society.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>So also is that of those who live by wages.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but the interest of those who live by profit has not the same connexion with the general interest of the society.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>In the rude state of society stock is unnecessary.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Division of labour makes it necessary.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Accumulation of stock and division of labour advance together.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Accumulation causes the same quantity of industry to produce more.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>This Book treats of the nature of stock, the effects of its accumulation, and its different employments.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>A man does not think of obtaining revenue from a small stock,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but when he has more than enough for immediate consumption, he endeavours to derive a revenue from the rest,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>using it either as</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) circulating capital,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>or (2) fixed capital.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Different proportions of fixed and circulating capital are required in different trades.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The stock of a society is divided in the same way into</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) the portion reserved for immediate consumption,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) the fixed capital, which consists of</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and (3) the circulating capital, which consists of</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The last three parts of the circulating capital are regularly withdrawn from it.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Every fixed capital is derived from and supported by a circulating capital,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and cannot yield any revenue without it.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The end of both fixed and circulating capital is to maintain and augment the other part of the stock.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The circulating capital is kept up by the produce of land, mines, and fisheries,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>which require both fixed and circulating capitals to cultivate them,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and, when their fertility is equal, yield produce proportionate to the capital employed</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Where there is tolerable security all stock is employed in one or other of the three ways.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>But in countries where violence prevails much stock is buried and concealed.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Prices are divided into three parts, wages, profits, and rent,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and the whole annual produce is divided into the same three parts;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but we may distinguish between gross and net revenue.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Gross rent is the whole sum paid by the farmer; net rent what is left free to the landlord.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Gross revenue is the whole annual produce: net revenue what is left free after deducting the maintenance of fixed and circulating capital.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The whole expence of maintaining the fixed capital must be excluded,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>since the only object of the fixed capital is to increase the productive powers of labour,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and any cheapening or simplification is regarded as a good.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The cost of maintaining the fixed capital is like the cost of repairs on an estate,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but the expence of maintaining the last three parts of the circulating capital is not to be deducted,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>the circulating capital of the society being different in this respect from that of an individual</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The maintenance of the money alone must be deducted.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The money resembles the fixed capital, since</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) the maintenance of the stock of money is part of the gross but not of the net revenue,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and (2) the money itself forms no part of the net revenue.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It only appears to do so from the ambiguity of language, sums of money being often used to indicate the goods purchaseable as well as the coins themselves.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>We must not add both together.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>If a man has a guinea a week he enjoys a guinea&#x2019;s worth of subsistence, &amp;c.,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and his real revenue is that subsistence, &amp;c.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The same is true of all the inhabitants of a country.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The coins annually paid to an individual often equal his revenue, but the stock of coin in a society is never equal to its whole revenue.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Money is therefore no part of the revenue of the society.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(3) Every saving in the cost of maintaining the stock of money is an improvement.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The substitution of paper for gold money is an improvement.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Bank notes are the best sort of paper money.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>When a banker lends out &#xA3;100,000 in notes and keeps in hand only &#xA3;20,000 in gold and silver, &#xA3;80,000 in gold and silver is spared from the circulation:</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and if many bankers do the same, four-fifths of the gold and silver previously circulating may be sent abroad,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and exchanged for goods.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>either to supply the consumption of another country, in which case the profit will be an addition to the net revenue of the country,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>or to supply home consumption (1) of luxuries, (2) of materials, tools and provisions wherewith industrious people are maintained and employed.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>If to supply luxuries, prodigality and consumption are increased, if to supply materials, &amp;c., a permanent fund for supporting consumption is provided.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The greater part of the gold and silver sent abroad purchases materials, &amp;c.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The quantity of industry which the circulating capital can employ is determined by the provisions, materials, and finished work, and not at all by the quantity of money.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The substitution of paper for gold and silver increases the materials, tools, and maintenance at the expense of the gold and silver money.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The quantity of money bears a small proportion to the whole produce, but a large one to that part destined to maintain industry.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>An operation of this kind has been carried out in Scotland with excellent effects.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>There was at the Union at least a million sterling of gold and silver money, and now there is not half a million.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Notes are ordinarily issued by discounting bills,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but the Scotch banks in vented the system of cash accounts,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>which enable them to issue notes readily,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and make it possible for every merchant to carry on a greater trade than he otherwise could.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The Scotch banks can of course discount bills when required.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The whole of the paper money can never exceed the gold and silver which would have been required in its absence.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The peculiar expenses of a bank are (1) the keeping and (2) the replenishing of a stock of money with which to repay notes.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>A bank which issues too much paper will much increase both the first</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and the second expense.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>as may be shown by an example.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Banks have sometimes not understood this,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and the Scotch banks.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The excessive circulation was caused by overtrading</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>A bank ought not to advance more than the amount which merchants would otherwise have to keep by them in cash</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>This limit is observed when only real bills of exchange are discounted.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Cash accounts should be carefully watched to secure the same end,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>as they were for a long time by the Scotch banks, which required frequent and regular operations,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and thus (1) were able to judge of the circumstances of their debtors,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and (2) were secured against issuing too much paper.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Bankers&#x2019; loans ought to be only for moderate periods of time.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>More than twenty-five years ago the proper amount of paper money had been reached in Scotland,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but the traders were not content,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and some of them resorted to drawing and redrawing,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>which shall be explained</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Bills of exchange have extraordinary legal privileges.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>So two persons, one in London and one in Edinburgh, would draw bills on each other.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Much money was raised in this expensive way.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The bill on London would be discounted in Edinburgh, and the bill on Edinburgh discounted in London,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and each was always replaced by another.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The amount thus advanced by the banks was in excess of the limit laid down above, but this was not perceived at first.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>When the banks found it out they made difficulties about discounting,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>which alarmed and enraged the projectors,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>then the Ayr bank was established and advanced money very freely,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but soon got into difficulties,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and was obliged to stop in two years.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Its action and failure increased the distress of projectors and the country generally,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but relieved the other Scotch banks.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Another plan would have been to raise money on the securities pledged by borrowers:</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>this would have been a losing business,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and even if profitable would have been hurtful to the country.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Law&#x2019;s scheme has been sufficiently explained by Du Verney and Du Tot</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The bank of England was established in 1694,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>enlarged its stock in 1697</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>in 1708,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>in 1709 and 1710,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>in 1717, and later.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The rate of interest received by it from the public has been reduced from 8 to 3 per cent. and its dividend has lately been 5&#xBD; per cent.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It acts as a great engine of state.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The operations of banking turn dead stock into productive capital,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but make its commerce and industry somewhat less secure</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Precautions should be taken to prevent the greater part of the circulation being filled with paper.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Circulation may be divided into that between dealers and that between dealers and consumers.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The circulation of paper may be confined to the former by not allowing notes for small sums.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The issue of such notes enables mean people to become bankers.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>None for less than &#xA3;5 should be issued.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>This would secure the circulation of plenty of gold and silver,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and would not prevent banks from giving sufficient assistance to traders.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>A law against small notes would be a violation of natural liberty necessary for the security of the society.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Paper money payable on demand is equal to gold and silver,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and does not raise prices;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but paper not repayable on demand would fall below gold and silver,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>as happened in Scotland during the prevalence of the Optional Clause,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and must have happened in regard to the Yorkshire currencies when small sums were repayable in guineas.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The North American paper currencies consisted of government notes repayable at a distant date,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and depreciated the currency to a great degree.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>They were therefore justly prohibited.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Pennsylvania was moderate in its issues, and its currency never went below the real par.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The colonial paper was somewhat supported by being received in payment of taxes.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>A requirement that certain taxes should be paid in particular paper money might give that paper a certain value even if it was irredeemable.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>A paper currency depreciated below the value of the coin does not sink the value of gold and silver.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The only restrictions on banking which are necessary are the prohibition of small bank notes and the requirement that all notes shall be repaid on demand.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>There are two sorts of labour, productive and unproductive</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Many kinds of labour besides menial service are unproductive.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The proportion of the produce employed in maintaining productive hands determines the next year&#x2019;s produce.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Part of the produce replaces capital, part constitutes profit and rent.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>That which replaces capital employs none but productive hands,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>while unproductive hands and those who do not labour are supported by revenue.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>So the proportion of productive hands depends on the proportion between profit with rent and the part of produce which replaces capital.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Rent anciently formed a larger proportion of the produce of agriculture than now.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Profits were anciently a larger share of the produce of manufactures,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>so the proportion of produce required for replacing capital is greater than it was.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The proportion between the funds determines whether the inhabitants of the country shall be industrious or idle.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Increase or diminution of the capital of a country consequently increases or diminishes its annual produce.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Capitals are increased by parsimony or saving.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>What is saved is consumed by productive hands.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The frugal man establishes a perpetual fund for the employment of productive hands.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The prodigal perverts such funds to other uses.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Whether he spends on home or foreign commodities makes no difference.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>If he had not spent there would have been just as much money in the country and the goods produced by productive hands as well</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Besides, when the annual produce diminishes, money will go abroad,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and on the other hand money will come in when the annual produce increases.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>So even if the real wealth of a country consisted of its money, the prodigal would be a public enemy.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Injudicious employment of capital has the same effect as prodigality.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Frugality and prudence predominate.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Prodigality is more intermittent than the desire to better our condition.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Imprudent undertakings are small in number compared to prudent ones.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Public prodigality and imprudence are more to be feared than private,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but are counteracted by private frugality and prudence.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>To increase the produce of a nation an increase of capital is necessary.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>If, therefore, the produce has increased, we may be sure the capital has increased.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>This has been the case of almost all nations in peaceable times.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>England for example from 1660 to 1776,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>or from 1558 to 1660,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>though there was much public and private profusion, and many other disorders and misfortunes occurred.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Private frugality and prudence have silently counteracted these circumstances.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>A part from increase or diminution of capital different kinds of expense may be distinguished.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>An individual who spends on durable commodities will be richer than one who spends on perishable ones.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The same thing is true of a nation.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The former expense is easier to bring to an end,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and gives maintenance to more people.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It does not follow that it betokens a more generous spirit.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Stock lent at interest is a capital to the lender, but may or may not be so to the borrower.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Generally it is so to the borrower,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>except in case of mortgages effected by country gentlemen.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Loans are made in money, but what the borrower wants and gets is goods.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>So the quantity of stock which can be lent is determined by the value of that part of the produce which replaces such capital as the owner does not himself employ.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>This may be much greater than the actual money employed.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The money is altogether different from what is actually assigned either as principal or interest.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The stock to be lent at interest naturally grows as the whole quantity of stock increases.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Interest falls as the quantity of stock to be lent increases,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>because profits diminish as it becomes more difficult to find a profitable method of employing new capital.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The notion that it was the discovery of the West Indies which lowered interest has been refuted by Hume.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>If &#xA3;100 are now required to purchase what &#xA3;50 would have purchased then, &#xA3;10 must now be required to purchase what &#xA3;5 would have purchased then.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>An increase in the quantity of silver could only diminish its value.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Nominal wages would be greater, but real wages the same; profits would be the same nominally and really.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>An increase in the goods annually circulated would cause a fall of profits and consequently of interest.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The prohibition of interest is wrong, and increases the evil of usury.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Where a maximum rate is fixed, this should be somewhat above the market rate on good security,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but not much above, or the greater part of loans would be to prodigals and projectors.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>No law can reduce interest below the market rate.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The number of years&#x2019; purchase commonly paid for land depends on the rate of interest.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The quantity of labour put in motion and the value added to the annual produce by capitals vary with their employment.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>There are four different ways of employing capital,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>all of which are necessary,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) procuring rude produce,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) manufacturing,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(3) transportation,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and (4) distribution.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The employers of such capitals are productive labourers</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>the capital of the retailer employs only himself;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>the capital of the merchant employs sailors and carriers;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>the capital of the manufacturer employs his workmen;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>the capital of the farmer employs his servants and his cattle, and adds a much greater value to the annual produce than other capital.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Capitals employed in agriculture and retail trade must reside within the country,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>the capital of the merchant may reside anywhere;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>the capital of the manufacturer must be where the manufacture is, but that is not necessarily determined.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Whether the merchant who exports belongs to the country or not makes little difference.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The capital of the manufacturer will put into motion more native labour if it resides within the country, but may be useful even if outside it.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Particular countries often have not enough capital for cultivation, manufactures, and transportation</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>In such cases the larger the proportion employed in agriculture, the larger will be the annual produce.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The quickest way to make the capital sufficient for all these purposes is to begin with the most profitable.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>That they have done so is the principal cause of the progress of the American colonies.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Great countries have scarcely ever acquired sufficient capital for all those purposes.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Different kinds of wholesale trade employ different quantities of productive labour and add different amounts to the annual produce.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>There are three different kinds of trade home, foreign and carrying.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Capital employed in buying in one part of the country to sell in another replaces two domestic capitals.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Capital employed in importation replaces one domestic and one foreign capital.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Its returns are not so quick as those of home trade.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Roundabout foreign trade has the same effect as direct.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Foreign trade carried on by means of gold and silver is in no way different from the rest.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Capital employed in the carrying trade replaces two foreign capitals.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It may employ ships and sailors belonging to the country, but this is not always the case,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and equal capital employed in importation or coasting trade may employ as many ships and men.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Capital in home trade therefore supports more productive labour than capital employed in foreign trade, which, however, supports more than capital in the carrying trade Political economy ought consequently not to allure capital into the foreign or the carrying trade,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>though each is advantageous when naturally introduced.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The surplus of the produce of particular branches of industry must be sent abroad.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Foreign goods obtained in exchange must often be reexported.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>When the other employments are full, the surplus capital disgorges itself into the carrying trade, which is a symptom rather than a cause of great national wealth.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The possible extent of the carrying trade is much the greatest.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Agriculture does not yield sufficient profit to attract all the capital which it might absorb.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The reason will be explained in the next two books.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The great commerce is that between town and country, which is obviously advantageous to both.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The cultivation of the country must be prior to the increase of the town,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>though the town may sometimes be distant from the country from which it derives its subsistence.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>This order of things is favoured by the natural preference of man for agriculture.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Cultivators require the assistance of artificers, who settle together and form a village, and their employment augments with the improvement of the country.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>In the American colonies an artificer who has acquired sufficient stock becomes a planter instead of manufacturing for distant sale,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>as in countries where no uncultivated land can be procured.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Manufactures are naturally preferred to foreign commerce.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>So the natural course of things is first agriculture, then manufactures, and finally foreign commerce.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>But this order has been in many respects inverted.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>After the fall of the Roman Empire all the land of Western Europe was engrossed, chiefly by large proprietors.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Primogeniture and entails prevented the great estates being divided.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Primogeniture was introduced because every great landlord was a petty prince.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It is now unreasonable, but supports the pride of family distinctions.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Entails have the same origin,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and are now absurd.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Great proprietors are seldom great improvers.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The occupiers were not likely to improve, as they were slaves attached to the land and incapable of acquiring property.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Slave labour is the dearest of all.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>At present sugar and tobacco can afford slave cultivation, corn cannot.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The slaves were succeeded by metayers,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>who are very different in that they can acquire property.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>But they could have no interest to employ stock in improvement.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Metayers were followed by farmers, who sometimes find it to their interest to improve when they have a lease, but leases were long insecure.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The forty-shilling freeholder vote in England contributes to the security of the farmer.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The law of Scotland is not quite so favourable.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>In the rest of Europe the farmer is less secure.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Customary services were vexatious to the farmer,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and so also were compulsory labour on the roads,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>purveyance</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and tallages.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Even under the best laws the farmer is at a disadvantage in improving,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but large farmers are the principal improvers after small proprietors.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The common prohibition of the export of corn and the restraints on internal trade in agricultural produce were further discouragements to agriculture.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The townsmen were not at first favoured more than the countrymen.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>They were very nearly of servile condition,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but arrived at liberty much earlier than the country people, acquiring the farm of their town,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>first for a term of years and afterwards in perpetuity,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>as well as other privileges equivalent to freedom,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and a government of their own.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It seems strange that sovereigns should have abandoned the prospect of increased revenue and have erected independent republics,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but the towns were the natural allies of the sovereign against the lords.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The sovereigns who quarrelled most with the barons were the most liberal to the towns.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The city militia was often able to overpower the neighbouring lords, as in Italy and Switzerland.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>In France and England the cities could not be taxed without their own consent.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>In consequence of this greater security of the towns industry flourished and stock accumulated there earlier than in the country.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Cities on the sea-coast or on navigable rivers are not dependent on the neighbouring country</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The cities of Italy were the first to grow opulent, being centrally situated and benefited by the crusades.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The cities imported manufactures and luxuries from richer countries, which were paid for by rude produce.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Demand for such manufactured articles having become considerable, their manufacture was established in the cities.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>All countries have some manufactures.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Sometimes manufactures for distant sale are introduced in imitation of foreign manufactures.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Sometimes they have grown up out of the coarser home manufactures.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The rise of towns benefited the country,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>because they afforded (1) already market for its produce,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) because merchants bought land in the country and improved it,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and (3) because order and good government were introduced.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Before foreign commerce and fine manufactures are introduced great proprietors are surrounded by bands of retainers,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and tenants at will were just as dependent as retainers.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The power of the ancient barons was founded on this.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It was anterior to and independent of the feudal law.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It was moderated by the feudal law,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and undermined by foreign commerce.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>At present a rich man maintains in all as many persons as an ancient baron, but he contributes only a small portion of the maintenance of each person.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>To meet their new expenses the great proprietors dismissed their retainers and their unnecessary tenants, and gave the remaining tenants long leases,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>thus making them independent.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The great proprietors thus became insignificant.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Old families are rare in commercial countries.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>A revolution was thus insensibly brought about,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and commerce and manufactures became the cause of the improvement of the country.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>This order of things is both slow and uncertain compared with the natural order, as may be shown by the rapid progress of the North American colonies,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and the slow progress of England in agriculture in spite of favours accorded to it</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and the still slower progress of France,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Spain and Portugal.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Italy alone was improved throughout by foreign commerce and exported manufactures.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The national capital acquired by commerce and manufactures is an uncertain possession till realised in the improvement of land</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The first object of political economy is to provide subsistence for the people</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Two different systems proposed for this end will be explained.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Wealth and money in common language are considered synonymous.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Similarly the Tartars thought wealth consisted of cattle.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Locke thought gold and silver the most substantial part of the wealth of a nation.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Others say that it is necessary to have much money in order to maintain fleets and armies abroad.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>So all European nations have tried to accumulate gold and silver.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>At first by a prohibition of exportation,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but merchants found this inconvenient,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and therefore argued that exportation did not always diminish the stock in the country,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and that the metals could be retained only by attention to the balance of trade.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Their arguments were partly sophistical,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but they convinced parliaments and councils.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The exportation of foreign coin and bullion was permitted by France and England, and the exportation of Dutch coin by Holland.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>That treasure was obtained by foreign trade became a received maxim.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Gold and silver will be imported without any attention of government,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>They can be imported more easily than other commodities when there is an effectual demand.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>When their quantity exceeds the demand it is impossible to prevent their exportation,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and it would be equally impossible to prevent their importation if the supply fell short of the effectual demand.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It is this ease of transportation which makes the value of gold and silver so uniform.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>If they did fall short, their place could be supplied by paper.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The common complaint of scarcity of money only means difficulty in borrowing.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Money makes but a small part of the national capital.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It is easier to buy than to sell simply because money is the instrument of commerce.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The durability of a commodity is no reason for accumulating more of it than is wanted.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Accumulation of gold and silver is not necessary for carrying on distant wars,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>which may be paid for by exporting: (1) gold and silver, (2) manufactures, or (3) rude produce</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The gold and silver consists of money in circulation, plate, and money in the treasury.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Little can be spared from the money in circulation;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>plate has never yielded much;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>accumulation in the treasury has been abandoned.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The foreign wars of the century have evidently not been paid for from the money in circulation,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but by commodities.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Part of the bullion which circulates from country to country may have been employed, but it must have been purchased with commodities.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The finer manufactures are the most convenient commodities for the purpose.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Rude produce is inconvenient.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The principal benefit of foreign trade is not the importation of gold and silver, but the carrying out of surplus produce for which there is no demand and bringing back something for which there is.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The discovery of America has benefited Europe not by the cheapening of gold and silver,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but by opening up of a new market which improved the productive powers of labour.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The discovery of the sea passage to the East Indies would have been still more advantageous if the trade to the East Indies had been free.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The exportation of silver to the East Indies is not harmful.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Writers who begin by including lands, houses and consumable goods in wealth often forget them later.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Wealth being supposed to consist in gold and silver, political economy endeavoured to diminish imports and encourage exports,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>by restraints upon importation</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and encouragements to exportation,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>which restraints and encouragements will be considered in the next six chapters.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>High duties and prohibitions giving a monopoly to a particular home industry are very common.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>They encourage the particular industry, but neither increase general industry nor give it the best direction.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The number of persons employed cannot exceed a certain proportion to the capital of the society,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and every man&#x2019;s interest leads him to seek that employment of capital which is most advantageous to the society.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) He tries to employ it as near home as possible</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) He endeavours to produce the greatest possible value.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>He can judge of this much better than the statesman.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>High duties and prohibitions direct people to employ capital in producing at home what they could buy cheaper from abroad</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It is as foolish for a nation as for an individual to make what can be bought cheaper.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Sometimes by such regulations a manufacture may be established earlier than it would otherwise have been, but this would make capital accumulate slower,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and the country might always be just as rich if it never acquired the manufacture.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>No one proposes that a country should strive against great natural advantages, but it is also absuid to strive against smaller advantages whether natural or acquired.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Merchants and manufacturers get the most benefit from high duties and prohibitions.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The free importation of foreign cattle would make no great difference to British graziers.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It might even benefit the cultivated plains at the expense of the rugged mountainous districts.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The free importation of salt provisions also would make little difference to the graziers,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and even the free importation of corn would not much affect the farmers.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Country gentlemen and farmers are less subject to the spirit of monopoly than merchants and manufacturers.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The prohibition of foreign corn and cattle restraints the population.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>There are two cases which are exceptional,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) when a particular industry is necessary for the defence of the country, like shipping, which is properly encouraged by the act of navigation,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>a wise act, though dictated by animosity,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and unfavourable to foreign commerce;</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and (2) when there is a tax on the produce of the like home manufacture.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Some people say that this principle justifies a general imposition of duties on imports to counterbalance taxes levied at home on necessaries,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>but there is a difference,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Taxes on necessaries are commonest in the richest countries because no others could support them</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>There are two other possible exceptions to the general principle</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) Retaliation</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>may be good policy where it is likely to secure the abolition of foreign restraints.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) It may be desirable to introduce freedom of trade by slow gradations.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>But the disorder occasioned by its sudden introduction would be less than is supposed since</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>especially if the privileges of corporations and the law of settlement were abolished.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Private interests are too strong to allow of the restoration of freedom of trade in Great Britain.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The fact that equitable regard is due to the manufacturer who has fixed capital in his business is an argument against the establishment of new monopolies.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Customs duties imposed for revenue remain to be considered hereafter</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>British restraints on imports from France are an example.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Such restraints are unreasonable on the principles of the mercantile system, since</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) if free trade with France did lead to an unfavourable balance with France, it might yet not do so with the world in general,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) a part of French imports might be re-exported and bring back gold and silver,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and (3) the balance cannot be certainly known:</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>custom-house books are useless,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and the course of exchange is little better.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>A favourable exchange with a particular country does not prove a favourable balance with that country.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Besides, the ordinary computation of exchange is often misleading, since</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(1) money is often below its nominal standard,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>(2) coin is sometimes raised by seignorage above the value of the bullion contained in it,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and (3) bank money bears an agio.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Small states must admit foreign coin, which is of uncertain value.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Banks are then established to pay in standard money regardless of the condition of the coin, and this money bears an agio.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Before 1609 the common currency of Amsterdam was 9 per cent. below the standard.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The bank was then established to receive and pay coin at its intrinsic value in good standard money.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Money in the bank was not only up to the standard, but also secure and easily transferred, so that it bore an agio.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The bank receives bullion as well as coin, giving in exchange a credit in bank money to 95 per cent of the value.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It also gives a receipt which entitles the bearer to recover the bullion on repaying the sum advanced and paying &#xBC; per cent. for silver and &#xBD; per cent. for gold.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The receipts are generally worth something, and are renewed at the end of each six months.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The depositor usually parts with his receipt.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The bank money and the receipt together equal in value the bullion deposited.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Receipts for current coin are also given, but these are often of no value and are allowed to expire.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>So there is a considerable sum of bank money for which the receipts have expired, but it is not a large proportion of the whole.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>This cannot be drawn out of the bank.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>So that if all the holders of bank money desired to exchange it for coin and bullion receipts might command an exorbitant price.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Of late years the bank has always sold bank money at 5 per cent. agio and bought at 4 per cent.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It professes to lend out no part of the deposits.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The amount of treasure in the bank is a subject of conjecture.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The city derives a considerable revenue from the various profits of the bank.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The whole doctrine of the balance of trade is absurd.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Where there is an even balance and the exchange consists wholly of native commodities two countries trading will gain nearly equally.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>If one exported nothing but native commodities, and the other nothing but foreign, both would gain, but the first would gain most.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Mixed cases conform to the principle.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>It would be no worse for England to pay in gold and silver than in tobacco.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The arguments against the French wine trade are fallacious.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The sneaking arts of underling tradesmen have been erected into political maxims and commerce has become a source of discord instead of unity.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The sophistry of merchants inspired by the spirit of monopoly has confounded the common-sense of mankind.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Wealthy neighbours are an advantage to a nation as well as an individual.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>The French trade, if not restrained, would be much more advantageous to Great Britain than the American.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>But the traders of France and England are jealous of each other.</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>No country has ever been impoverished by an unfavourable balance, and those which have the freest trade have been the most enriched by foreign trade</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>Prosperity and decay depend on the balance of produce and consumption,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>which is quite different from the balance of trade,</span></span>
<span class="type-margin"><span>and may be constantly in favour of a nation when the balance of trade is against it.</span></span>
